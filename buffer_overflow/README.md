# Buffer Overflow Example
This example demonstrates a basic buffer overflow vulnerability in C programming language. The program accepts an
input string from the user, copies it into a fixed-size buffer without checking if it fits, and then prints the
buffer content. This may lead to unexpected behavior when the input is longer than expected.

**Usage:**
Compile the program using `gcc -o overflow_example overflow_example.c` and run with `./overflow_example <input>`.

**Code:**
```c
// Include necessary libraries:
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    // Declare a small buffer of size 5
    char buffer[5];

    if (argc < 2) {
        // Check if input is provided
        printf("Usage: %s <input>\n", argv[0]);
        return 1;
    }

    // Copy the input string into the small buffer without checking its size
    strcpy(buffer, argv[1]);

    // Print the content of the buffer
    printf("Buffer content: %s\n", buffer);

    return 0;
}
```
**Explanation:**
This code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack because it doesn't check if the input string provided by the
user fits into the `buffer` array. If the input string is longer than the buffer size (5 bytes), it will overwrite
memory beyond the allocated buffer, potentially leading to unpredictable program behavior or security
vulnerabilities.
